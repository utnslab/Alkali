# EP2 Netronome Backend Library

## Code Structure
```bash
./ep2_src/example.ep2   # EP2 source code example
./src                   # Code that should be generated by the EP2 compiler
./lib                   # Library functions for EP2 Netronome backend 
./microc                # Netronome micro C libaray
```
## Build
```bash
cd src
make
```

## Run it in Simulator
```
After make, ./core.fw will be generated under ./src.
Follow instruction in [this link](https://wikis.utexas.edu/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=utns&title=Netronome+NIC+Simulator) to submit the binary to submit ./core.fw to the simulator.

Will soon provide a detailed instruction of how to verify the program output in the netronome simulator.
